# ImageInjectorPlugin
ProcessorPlugin for MicroManager 2.0 which replaces 
images in the processing pipeline with ones from a user-selected .tiff image stack.
This can be useful for debugging or performing demos.

Developed by Marcel Stefko at Laboratory of Experimental Biophysics EPFL, under
supervision of Kyle M. Douglass, PhD.

## Installation
Copy `ImageInjector.jar` from one of the [releases](https://github.com/MStefko/ImageInjectorPlugin/releases) into the `Micro-Manager2.0/mmplugins` folder.
